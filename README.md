## ✨ Key Features

### 📂 Smart Organization
- **Threads**: Group multiple logs into a single conversation thread using intuitive drag-and-drop.
- **Smart Deletion**: When deleting a thread header, choose between deleting the entire thread or just the specific log.
- **Tags**: Instantly find logs using tags or specific models (tag:tag or tag:model).

### 🔄 Seamless Sync & Privacy
- **Direct Peer-to-Peer Sync**: Synchronize your data directly between your own devices without relying on central servers, through a secure P2P mechanism.
- **Local-first Architecture**: All data is stored in the browser's IndexedDB (via Dexie.js). Your logs stay private and never leave your control.
- **Offline Capable**: Fully functional without an internet connection. Install it as a standalone app on both desktop and mobile.

### 🎨 Premium UX/UI
- **Theme Support**: Includes both Dark and Light modes with global font-size adjustments.
